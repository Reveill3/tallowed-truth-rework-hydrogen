        <div className='text-2xl'>
          Tallow is a purified fat made from melted down (rendered) cow fat or
          suet
        </div>
        <div className='text-2xl'>
          Once rendered the fat becomes shelf-stable while maintaining the rich
          profile of nutrients and vitamins from the original animal source.
        </div>
        <div className='text-2xl'>
          The fatty acids in tallow are very similar to those in human skin,
          allowing for easy absorption of all the nutrients in the tallow.
        </div>
        <div className='text-2xl'>
          The result is an almost shocking healing and restorative process that
          results in firmer, and softer skin while creating an attractive yet
          subtle "glow."
